                        <p> In high school, our English teacher tasked us with writing a <a id="tribute-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku" target="_blank"> Haiku poem</a> about the person we love the most. 
                            I chose to write my haiku about my mother who passed away just a week before this assignment was given.

                        <p><strong>A:</strong> The one I loved the most is my mama.</p> 
                        <p><strong>B:</strong> Her passing has brought me closer for sure.</p>
                        <p><strong>A:</strong> When I was born all I said was gaga.</p>
                        <p><strong>B:</strong> But she understood me; her love was pure. </p>  
                        <br>
                        <p><strong>C:</strong> When I was five I won the Angels Crown. </p> 
                        <p><strong>D:</strong> From her I get my sweet voice and bright smile.</p>
                        <p><strong>C:</strong> She taught me to look up and never down.</p>
                        <p><strong>D:</strong> Even when her health presented a trial.  </p>
                        <br>
                        <p><strong>E:</strong> She was there to see me get my letter. </p> 
                        <p><strong>F:</strong> At her service we said a fond goodbye.</p>
                        <p><strong>E:</strong> I miss her, but I know she's all better.</p>
                        <p><strong>F:</strong> I love her, and think of her and sigh. </p>
                        <br>
                        <p><strong>G:</strong> Her sweet pure name is Teethina Cherry </p> 
                        <p><strong>G:</strong> I want to be like her when I marry. </p>
